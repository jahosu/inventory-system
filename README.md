![Recording 2024-08-26 at 08 50 59](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68cc83ba-2529-4224-bd38-a290c143deb8)

An inventory system originally made for my game 'Tale of Akz',
it is extendible, as I did it by making hot-bar, merchant-system,
bartender-system, shipyard, and so on.

I made the inventory as a separate project and wrote a tutorial
on how ot create it [on my site here](https://gameidea.org/2024/08/26/make-inventory-system-in-godot/).

Feel free to fork it, make changes and use in your game.
Consider supporting me if you believe it helped.
